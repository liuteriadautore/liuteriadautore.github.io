<p>Being a professional double bassist myself, with a quite large experience in both orchestral and contemporary repertoire, my first professional focus was the Double Bass; however, I work with the whole family of violins and viols, both as a maker and a restorer. And yes, as a player too.</p>
<p>I created many <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/liuteriadautore/photos/?tab=albums&ref=page_internal">models</a> of basses, for a wide range of aesthetic and musical environments  and I created also a kind of portable bass, which I dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/contrabassetto/photos/?tab=albums&ref=page_internal">contrabassetto</a>. I'm working now on a portable strings family concept - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reductio.liuteriadautore/?view_public_for=1168211266688479">

<p>My second favourite instrument, as a maker, is the viola... I had the chance to be a close friend, and apprentice, of a great master, Nilton Camargo, which was an outstanding violas maker. He shared many deep insights in regard his love and understanding of the violas mechanic, and helped me outlining and conceiving my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/liuteriadautore/photos/a.694579387273130/694579417273127/?type=3&theater">first one</a>, a personal modernization of an outstanding Gasparo da Salò model for a <a href="https://www.ashmoleanprints.com/image/1056157/gasparo-gasparo-da-salo-bertolotti-lira-da-braccio-1561">Lira da Braccio</a>...</p>
