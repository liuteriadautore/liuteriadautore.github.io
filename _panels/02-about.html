<p>I'm born in Italy, Faenza, where I started playing the cello and bass guitar. It is also where I accomplished my fine arts studies at the international school for artistical ceramic.
This gave me a solid background on renaissance arts, as well as a quite deep understanding of sculpture, drawing and painting techniques.</p>

<p>My artistical biases are strongly rooted on the common grounds of the renaissance thoughts: pytagorean and natural mathematical principles, sacred geometry, alchemical simbology and alikes: in fact, I live luthiery not as a duty, but as a way for the self trascendence.</p>
<p>Those probably are the reasons for my preferences for the old school workflow: using almost only traditional hand tools, like gouges, handplanes and dividers, with very few technological departures (a bandsaw, a drill press, and my CAD), I try for a personal, artistically true and solidly honest approach.</p>
